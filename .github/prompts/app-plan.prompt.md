Create an implementation plan for the specifications outlined in `docs/specs.md`.

## Rules:

-Keep implementations simple, do not over architect
-Do not generate real code yet, pseudocode is OK
-For each step in your plan, include the objective of the step, the steps to achieve that objective, and any necessary pseudocode.

## Guidelines for Creating or Updating a Plan

- Before generating the implementation plan, be sure to review the `docs/design/proposal.md` file to understand an overview of the project.
- When creating a plan, organize it into numbered phases (e.g., "Phase 1: Setup Dependencies")
- Break down each phase into specific tasks with numeric identifiers (e.g., "Task 1.1: Add Dependencies")
- Please only create one document per plan
- Mark phases and tasks as `- [ ]` while not complete and `- [x]` once completed
- End the plan with success criteria that define when the implementation is complete
- Plans that you produce should go under `docs/plans`
- Use a consistent naming convention `YYYYMMDD-<short-description>.md` for plan files
- Plans should start with writing Unit Tests first when possible, so we can use those to guide our implementation. Same for UI tests when it makes sense.
