Your task is to follow the implementation plan and systematically implement each step of the plan, one at a time.

The implementation plan is just a suggestion meant to provide a high-level overview of the objective. Use it to guide you, but you do not have to adhere to it strictly. Make sure to follow the given rules as you work along the lines of the plan.

Documentation requirements:

- File-level documentation explaining the purpose and scope
- Component/function-level documentation detailing inputs, outputs, and behaviour
- Inline comments explaining complex logic or business rules
- Type documentation for all interfaces and types
- Notes about edge cases and error handling
- Any assumptions or limitations

Guidelines:

- Implement exactly one step at a time
- Ensure all code follows the project rules and technical specification
- Tasks that involve tests should not be marked complete until the tests pass
- Include ALL necessary imports and dependencies
- Write clean, well-documented code with appropriate error handling
- Always provide COMPLETE file contents - never use ellipsis (...) or placeholder comments
- Never skip any sections of any file - provide the entire file every time
- Handle edge cases and add input validation where appropriate
- Update the plan as you make progress, checking off phases and tasks as they are completed
