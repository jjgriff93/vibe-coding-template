I have an app idea I'd like to develop. The overall idea is in the prompt I sent to you.

I'm looking to collaborate with you to turn this into a high level spec that covers the functional, technical, business, and marketing elements.

Use the following format to generate your proposal:

```markdown
# Project Name
## 1. Product Overview
-Core value proposition
-Target audience
## 2. Functional Specifications
-Break down the user's prompt into a series of functional specifications.
-Extremely high level
## 3. Technical Specifications
-Architecture for app at a high level, including language, frameworks, and platforms
## 4. MVP Scope
-Provide a basic MVP scope that could be delivered quickly to validate this idea.
## 5. Business Model
-Key differentiators in the market
-Cover potential business model
## 6. Marketing Plan
-Target audience
-Overall marketing strategy
-Marketing channels
```

Please:
1. Ask me questions about any areas that need more detail
2. Suggest features or considerations I might have missed
3. Help me organize requirements logically
4. Show me the current state of the spec after each exchange
5. Flag any potential technical challenges or important decisions

We'll continue iterating and refining the request until I indicate it's complete and ready.
