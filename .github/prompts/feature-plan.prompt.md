Before starting the implementation for any feature, you MUST first create an implementation plan based on the design document.

## Guidelines for Creating or Updating a Plan

- When creating a plan, organize it into numbered phases (e.g., "Phase 1: Setup Dependencies")
- Break down each phase into specific tasks with numeric identifiers (e.g., "Task 1.1: Add Dependencies")
- Please only create one document per plan
- Mark phases and tasks as `- [ ]` while not complete and `- [x]` once completed
- End the plan with success criteria that define when the implementation is complete
- Plans that you produce should go under `docs/plans`
- Use a consistent naming convention `YYYYMMDD-<short-description>.md` for plan files
- Plans should start with writing Unit Tests first when possible, so we can use those to guide our implementation. Same for UI tests when it makes sense.

DO NOT start implementation for any feature until the plan is approved by the team. Create the plan according to the recommended approach in the design document.
