# Technical Specification: 2.1 Users can view their daily water consumption total and adjust it by adding or removing customizable amounts

## 1. Data Model

- **WaterConsumptionEntry**
  - `id: UUID` - Unique identifier for each day's entry (Example: "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000")
  - `amount: Double` - Total water amount for the day in selected unit (Example: 1750.0)
  - `date: Date` - The date this entry corresponds to (Example: "2025-02-26")
  
- **WaterUnit**
  - `enum: String` - Unit of measurement (Example: "ml" or "oz")

## 2. User Experience

### Main Water Tracking Screen

**Purpose:** Allow users to view their current day's water consumption and easily add or remove water amounts.

**UI Components:**
- Current total display (large text showing total consumption with unit)
- Progress indicator (visual representation of consumption against goal)
- Quick add buttons (3-4 preset amounts like 100ml, 250ml, 500ml)
- Remove button (to subtract water amounts)
- Custom amount button (to enter specific amounts)

**Implementation:**
1. CoreData will store and retrieve the single WaterConsumptionEntry for each day
2. ViewModel will fetch or create today's entry as needed
3. View will reactively update when the entry is modified
4. Animation will provide visual feedback when adding/removing water
5. Haptic feedback will confirm actions
6. Preset amounts will be stored as app configuration

### Custom Amount Modal

**Purpose:** Allow users to input specific water amounts not available in presets.

**UI Components:**
- Numeric input field with unit display
- Add/Remove toggle
- Confirmation button
- Cancel button

**Implementation:**
1. Modal presentation when custom amount button is tapped
2. Input validation to ensure positive numbers
3. Common amounts can be configured in app settings

## 3. Error Handling

- Prevent negative water consumption totals
- Validate custom input to ensure it's a valid number
- Provide visual feedback if an invalid amount is entered
- Handle edge cases like date changes at midnight

## 4. Testing Strategy

### UI Tests
1. Verify default preset buttons appear on main screen
2. Test adding water using each preset button
3. Test removing water using remove button
4. Test adding custom amount through modal
5. Verify consumption total updates correctly after each action
6. Verify consumption total persists across app restarts
7. Test edge case of crossing midnight (new day creates new entry)

### Unit Tests
1. Test updating daily consumption with positive amounts
2. Test updating daily consumption with negative amounts (removal)
3. Test validation to prevent negative totals
4. Test date-based retrieval of consumption entries
5. Test unit conversion between ml and oz
